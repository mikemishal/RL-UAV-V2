"""
Gymnasium-compatible environment for UAV defense RL training.

This is the UNIFIED environment used for BOTH:
  1. Baseline evaluation with hand-designed policies (e.g., GreedyInterceptPolicy)
  2. RL training with algorithms like PPO, SAC, TD3

The environment itself contains NO policy logic. All defender control is
provided externally via the `step(action)` interface.

Design Philosophy:
  - Environment provides dynamics and observations
  - Policy provides actions (whether scripted or learned)
  - Same environment instance works for evaluation and training

class SoldierEnv(gym.Env):
    """
    A three-dimensional constrained point-mass engagement environment for RL
    training with partial observability.

    NOTE: This is a 3D constrained point-mass UAV dynamics simulator. Both
    aircraft (defender and hostile UAV) maintain a persistent 3D velocity
    that approaches a controller/guidance-commanded desired velocity subject
    to bounded acceleration, a bounded horizontal turn rate, a maximum total
    speed, and bounded climb/descent rates. This is NOT six-DOF or
    aerodynamic flight dynamics, and the parameter defaults are provisional
    simulation values rather than validated hardware specifications.
    
    ============================================================================
    UNIFIED ENVIRONMENT FOR BASELINE AND RL
    ============================================================================
    This environment is designed to work identically for:
      - Scripted/baseline policies (e.g., GreedyInterceptPolicy)
      - RL algorithms (e.g., PPO from Stable-Baselines3)
    
    The environment contains NO hardcoded policy logic. The defender drone
    is controlled entirely by external actions passed to step().
    
    Usage with baseline policy:
        env = SoldierEnv()
        policy = GreedyInterceptPolicy()
        obs, info = env.reset(seed=42)
        while True:
            action = policy.act(obs, info)  # Policy provides action
            obs, reward, done, _, info = env.step(action)
            if done:
                break
    
    Usage with RL (Stable-Baselines3):
        from stable_baselines3 import PPO
        env = SoldierEnv()
        model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, verbose=1)
        model.learn(total_timesteps=100000)
    ============================================================================
    
    Domain: 3D engagement volume, x, y ∈ [-L, L] (horizontal) and z ∈ [0, H]
    (altitude), where H = max_altitude.
    
    Entities:
        - Soldier (s ∈ ℝ³): Planar Gaussian random walk (uncontrolled); always
          remains a ground entity with s_z = 0 at all times.
        - Defender (d ∈ ℝ³): Persistent 3D velocity that tracks a
          controller-commanded desired velocity subject to dynamic limits
          (acceleration, turn rate, climb/descent rate, max speed).
        - Enemy (e ∈ ℝ³): Persistent 3D velocity that tracks a weaving
          pursuit-commanded desired velocity, subject to the same class of
          dynamic limits; naturally descends toward the ground target while
          pursuing. Uses pursuit toward the protected soldier with
          stochastic weaving and proximity-triggered reactive evasion from
          the defender, executed through constrained 3D point-mass
          dynamics -- a parameterized reactive evasive policy, NOT
          intelligent adversarial RL, optimal-attacker, or game-theoretic
          behavior (see _compute_enemy_evasion and _move_enemy).
    
    Partial Observability with Shared Sensor Noise:
        - Before detection: Enemy state is MASKED (zeros)
        - After detection: a common noisy enemy-position measurement is
          generated every step from a dedicated sensor RNG stream, shared by
          BOTH the Direct and Kalman tracks (same sensor realization; only
          downstream processing differs)
        - If Kalman is enabled, e_hat/v_hat come from filtered estimates of that measurement
        - If Kalman is disabled, e_hat mirrors the raw measurement and v_hat
          mirrors its finite-difference velocity estimate (see below) --
          giving Direct and Kalman IDENTICAL observation semantics
          (position estimate + velocity estimate), differing only in the
          estimator used
        - Detection occurs when defender is within detection_radius of enemy (3D distance)
        - Policies never receive the true enemy state through observation channels
        - Defender motion is controlled entirely by external policy (action-driven)
    
    Observation Space (spaces.Box, shape=16, dtype=float32):
        All values normalized to [-1, 1]:
            [soldier_x, soldier_y, soldier_z,
             defender_x, defender_y, defender_z,
             defender_vx, defender_vy, defender_vz,
             detected_flag,
             hostile_pos_1..3, hostile_vel_1..3]
        - defender velocity is normalized by v_d (component-wise)
        - detected_flag: 0.0 (not detected) or 1.0 (detected)
        - Both tracks share IDENTICAL semantics: hostile_pos = position
          estimate of the hostile UAV, hostile_vel = velocity estimate,
          normalized by L/max_altitude (position) and v_e (velocity):
                - If use_kalman_tracking=True:
                    hostile_pos_1..3 = e_hat (Kalman estimated position),
                    hostile_vel_1..3 = v_hat (Kalman estimated velocity)
                - If use_kalman_tracking=False (environment default):
                    hostile_pos_1..3 = raw noisy enemy position measurement,
                    hostile_vel_1..3 = finite-difference measurement velocity
                    (zeros until a second measurement is available)
        - All hostile-related values are 0.0 before detection
    
    Action Space (spaces.Box, shape=3, dtype=float32):
        3D continuous action vector in [-1, 1]³, interpreted as a DESIRED
        velocity direction (not an instantaneous displacement command):
        - Normalized to unit vector if norm > eps -> desired_velocity = v_d * direction
        - If action norm <= eps, desired_velocity = [0,0,0] (command to stop)
        - The environment's constrained-velocity dynamics determine how
          quickly the defender's actual persistent velocity can turn,
          accelerate, or decelerate toward that desired velocity.
    
    Reward (dense shaping for RL, IDENTICAL for Direct and Kalman tracks --
    no estimator-dependent reward term, no hidden clipping):
        +100 for intercepting enemy safely (WIN)
        -100 for soldier caught (LOSS)
        -150 for unsafe intercept (intercept too close to soldier)
        -100 for timeout
        +5.0 * (prev_dist - curr_dist) for closing distance to enemy (using TRUE distance)
        -0.05 per step (encourages efficiency)
        proximity warning penalty scaled by closeness of enemy to soldier
        Tracking error (info["tracking_error"]) is an EVALUATION metric only
        and is never added to the reward.
    
    Termination (all distances are true 3D Euclidean distances):
        - Intercepted safely: dist_de < intercept_radius AND dist_es > unsafe_intercept_radius (WIN)
        - Soldier caught: dist_es < threat_radius (LOSS)
        - Unsafe intercept: dist_de < intercept_radius AND dist_es <= unsafe_intercept_radius (LOSS)
        - Timeout: step_count >= max_steps
    
    Gymnasium/SB3 Compatibility:
        - Passes gymnasium.utils.env_checker.check_env()
        - Compatible with Stable-Baselines3 algorithms
        - Fixed-size observation and action spaces
        - Proper reset() and step() signatures

        """
        Advance a persistent 3D point-mass velocity toward a desired velocity,
        subject to a maximum horizontal turn rate, maximum acceleration,
        maximum total speed, and maximum climb/descent rate.

        This is the single reusable constrained-velocity update shared by
        both the defender and the hostile UAV (a 3D constrained point-mass
        dynamics model — NOT six-DOF or aerodynamic flight dynamics).

        Order of operations:
          1. Vertical-rate command limiting: clip desired_velocity[2] into
             [-max_descent_rate, max_climb_rate].
          2. Horizontal turn-rate limiting: rotate the current horizontal
             heading toward the desired horizontal heading by at most
             max_turn_rate_rad * dt (shortest signed angular path, wrapped
             to [-pi, pi]), adopting the desired horizontal speed magnitude.
             Special cases (documented explicitly, not merely defaulted):
               - If current horizontal speed <= eps, the previous heading is
                 undefined; heading initializes directly toward the desired
                 heading with NO rate limit applied (there is nothing to
                 rate-limit against). Acceleration limiting (step 3) still
                 governs how quickly speed itself can rise.
               - If desired horizontal speed <= eps (e.g. a "stop" command),
                 heading has no defined target; the current heading is held
                 while horizontal speed is commanded toward zero.
             The result is the "dynamically permissible target velocity".
          3. Acceleration limiting: clip the change from current_velocity to
             the target velocity to at most max_accel * dt in magnitude,
             preserving the direction of the change. Because this is
             equivalent to next = current + t*(target - current) for some
             t in [0, 1], the result is a convex combination of current and
             target.
          4. Total-speed / vertical-rate safety enforcement: since both
             current_velocity and the target velocity already satisfy the
             max_speed ball and the climb/descent bounds (both are convex
             constraints), and step 3 produces a convex combination of the
             two, the result satisfies both bounds automatically. A
             defensive clip is applied regardless, to guard against
             floating-point overshoot (never used to silently paper over a
             design error).

        Args:
            current_velocity: Current persistent velocity [vx, vy, vz], shape (3,).
            desired_velocity: Controller/guidance-commanded desired velocity
                [vx, vy, vz], shape (3,); ||desired_velocity|| is expected to
                be <= max_speed (e.g. max_speed * unit_direction).
            max_speed: Maximum total speed (m/s).
            max_accel: Maximum acceleration magnitude (m/s^2).
            max_turn_rate_rad: Maximum horizontal heading-rate magnitude (rad/s).
            max_climb_rate: Maximum upward vertical speed (m/s), positive.

        is drawn from the dedicated sensor RNG stream (self._rng_sensor),
        shared by ALL controller modes -- this is the single sensor

        3. Horizontal lateral unit vector: lateral = [-r_hat_y, r_hat_x, 0],
           normalized; falls back to a fixed horizontal direction if the
           pursuit direction is (near-)vertical and the horizontal
           component is degenerate (norm <= eps)

        7. Normalize: u = u_raw / (||u_raw|| + eps)
        
        DYNAMICS (unchanged from the constrained-dynamics task): guidance
        produces a DESIRED velocity direction, not instantaneous motion.
        desired_velocity = v_e * u is fed through the same reusable
