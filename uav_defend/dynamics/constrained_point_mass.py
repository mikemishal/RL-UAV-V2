"""
Pure, dependency-free constrained 3-D point-mass dynamics helper.

Factored out of `uav_defend.envs.soldier_env.SoldierEnv._advance_velocity`
(the single canonical constrained-velocity update previously shared, via a
bound method, by both the defender and the hostile UAV). This module
contains EXACTLY the same equations, made into a pure function so that it
can be reused by planning/prediction code (e.g. the RMPC baseline) WITHOUT
constructing or mutating a `SoldierEnv` instance.

This is a 3-D constrained point-mass dynamics model -- NOT six-DOF or
aerodynamic flight dynamics.

`SoldierEnv._advance_velocity` is now a thin wrapper that delegates here
with `dt=self.config.dt, eps=self.config.eps` -- see
`test_constrained_point_mass_regression.py` for the regression proof that
this factoring preserves bit-for-bit-equivalent (within floating-point
tolerance) behavior versus the prior in-place implementation.

    Advance a persistent 3D point-mass velocity toward a desired velocity,
    subject to a maximum horizontal turn rate, maximum acceleration,
    maximum total speed, and maximum climb/descent rate.

    PURE function: does not read/mutate any environment, RNG, or global
    state; does not mutate its input arrays.

    Order of operations:
      1. Vertical-rate command limiting: clip desired_velocity[2] into
         [-max_descent_rate, max_climb_rate].
      2. Horizontal turn-rate limiting: rotate the current horizontal
         heading toward the desired horizontal heading by at most
         max_turn_rate_rad * dt (shortest signed angular path, wrapped
         to [-pi, pi]), adopting the desired horizontal speed magnitude.
         Special cases (documented explicitly, not merely defaulted):
           - If current horizontal speed <= eps, the previous heading is
             undefined; heading initializes directly toward the desired
             heading with NO rate limit applied (there is nothing to
             rate-limit against). Acceleration limiting (step 3) still
             governs how quickly speed itself can rise.
           - If desired horizontal speed <= eps (e.g. a "stop" command),
             heading has no defined target; the current heading is held
             while horizontal speed is commanded toward zero.
         The result is the "dynamically permissible target velocity".
      3. Acceleration limiting: clip the change from current_velocity to
         the target velocity to at most max_accel * dt in magnitude,
         preserving the direction of the change. Because this is
         equivalent to next = current + t*(target - current) for some
         t in [0, 1], the result is a convex combination of current and
         target.
      4. Total-speed / vertical-rate safety enforcement: since both
         current_velocity and the target velocity already satisfy the
         max_speed ball and the climb/descent bounds (both are convex
         constraints), and step 3 produces a convex combination of the
         two, the result satisfies both bounds automatically. A
         defensive clip is applied regardless, to guard against
         floating-point overshoot (never used to silently paper over a
         design error).

    Args:
        current_velocity: Current persistent velocity [vx, vy, vz], shape (3,).
        desired_velocity: Controller/guidance-commanded desired velocity
            [vx, vy, vz], shape (3,); ||desired_velocity|| is expected to
            be <= max_speed (e.g. max_speed * unit_direction).
        max_speed: Maximum total speed (m/s).
        max_accel: Maximum acceleration magnitude (m/s^2).
        max_turn_rate_rad: Maximum horizontal heading-rate magnitude (rad/s).
        max_climb_rate: Maximum upward vertical speed (m/s), positive.
        max_descent_rate: Maximum downward vertical speed magnitude (m/s), positive.
        dt: Time step duration (s).
        eps: Numerical-stability threshold.

    Returns:
        (next_velocity, diagnostics):
            next_velocity: Constrained velocity, shape (3,), float32.
            diagnostics: dict with keys "accel_used" (m/s^2, actually
                applied this step), "turn_rate_used_deg" (deg/s, actually
                applied this step), "accel_saturated" (bool),
                "turn_saturated" (bool), "climb_saturated" (bool, True if
